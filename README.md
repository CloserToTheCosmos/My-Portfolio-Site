<b>When did I start working on it?</b>
<p>I started building this website from [‎02 ‎July ‎2021, ‏‎18:51:40]</p>
<p>And I began my coding journey on 9th June, 2021. Hence this site makes me feel proud that I was able to build a multi page fully working, and is responsive on all size website.<strong>All this self-taught</strong></p>
