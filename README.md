# My-Portfolio-Site V1.0
https://closertothecosmos.github.io/My-Portfolio-Site/

<h4>When did I start working on it?</h4>
<p>I started building this website from [‎02 ‎July ‎2021, ‏‎18:51:40]</p>
<p>And I began my coding journey on 9th June, 2021. Hence this site makes me feel proud that I was able to build a multi page fully working, and is responsive on all size website.<strong>All this self-taught</strong></p>

<h4>Where did I learn from?</h4>
<p>My main source of learnings were from Googling (sites such as W3Schools, StackOverflow, GeeksforGeeks), Discord Servers, and the most effective one was from YouTube channels (CodeWithHarry, Web Dev Simplified, Kevin Powel, Stefan Mischook, LearnWebCode, Nomad Coders) and some while browsing creations made on GitHub or Codepen.</p>

<h4>What are the things I learnt while creating this site?</h4>
<p>On the broader terms, I learnt how to code  modern HTML & CSS. I learnt how the browser works. I learnt how the web works in general. I learnt about how there are different languages for different things. And I was able to create a blueprint for myself of getting into Front End Web Development completely.  </p>

<h4>What problems do you think this site has?</h4>
<p>Right after I deployed the site on GitHub, I was super happy and proud of myself for creating the best website in the world. But since the creation of the website to now when I'm updating my ReadMe (17th September, 2021) I have noticed so many flaws (mostly in the optimisations) The gallery page takes forever to load because of the sheer amount of pictures that I have used. There is no NavBar to toggle from and through, this website breaks so many rules of layout designing. <strong>But the takeaway is that I built this site with 0 investment in money. The main motive was for it to work and it does!</strong></p>

<h4>Is there a V2.0 coming?</h4>
<p>There's already one currently in the building stage. It will be built using React.js and it will be super fast!</p>
