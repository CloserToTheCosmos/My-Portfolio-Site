          Climate Change is very real and is already in action. It is our planet
          calling out for help. The message is clear, if we do not take any
          action right now to make sure that we have a slightest chance of
          survival then the time is now. Floods, Landslides and Wildfires are on
          the rise out of nowhere. Canada is suffering from a heat wave and
          Germany, China, India and few more countries are suffering from flash
          floods caused by cloud burst rains. These heavy rains are causing
          landslides which are disrupting the nearby civilization and many have
          already lost their lives while a few hundred are missing. This should
          definitely be a wakeup call for us and necessary actions must be taken
          in order to bring back the balance to life, because this is nature’s
          way of showing when the limits are crossed.

        <p id="body-article1">
          Recently, there’s an alarming rate of wild fires catching up in
          numerous places, and there are places which you would never imagine
          could catch a wild fire like the colder countries Norway and Siberia.
          Starting from Australia in 2020 to currently in Canada, Arizona,
          California, Oregon, Portland in the north and Amazon in the south of
          America, all in the same year 2021. Contrasting to this, countries in
          Europe mainly Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, and some Asian
          countries India, Turkey, China, Philippines, Oman, and the list goes
          on have been flash flooded by cloud bursts and heavy rains. This is
          something that has never happened before where one part of the world
          was burning and droughted and other part with severe flash floods. Let
          us see where the problem is. China, India and the United States hold
          the top three spots for Co2 emission. Efforts must be made by these
          three countries in order for the rest of the world to follow. UN says
          emission must be cut by 40% by the following decade or temperatures
          could rise drastically which can be fatal. Currently the world is
          under a havoc and is in a state we have never seen before. There are
          flash floods in some regions and wildfires in other regions. Report
          from NOAA states that Wildfire activity amid extreme heat and drought
          has resulted in smoke blanketing much of the United States and Canada.
          As of July 14, 2021, 68 active large fires in 12 states have burned
          more than one million acres of land in the U.S. To date in 2021, more
          than 34,000 fires have burned more than two million acres. This is the
          most fires in the January to July time period since 2011. July is
          relatively early to see wildfire activity of this magnitude. NOAA
          satellites are monitoring the fires, their smoke output, and air
          quality effects from the smoke. The fires are injecting smoke 40,000
          feet into the atmosphere and compromising air quality. New York was
          under a smoke blanket causing irritation and difficulty to breathe for
          the residents of NYC. The Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon is currently
          the nation’s largest active fire. This large, rapidly growing fire
          began on July 6 and had burned 212,377 acres as of July 14. The Oregon
          Department of Environmental Quality issued an air quality advisory for
          south-central and north-eastern Oregon through July 16. InciWeb warned
          that the fire will continue to be extremely active, fuelled by extreme
          drought conditions, low humidity, and high temperatures. And speaking
          of the floods in Germany, the problems are more than just damage and
          destruction. It is now facing Waste Management crisis. July 23
          Germany's most devastating floods in 60 years have created mountains
          of trash, from broken fridges to wrecked cars, piled up on roadsides
          and in makeshift dumps. Disposing of it could take weeks and local
          leaders have appealed for help. Amid the stench and fear of disease,
          the country that pioneered modern waste management is struggling to
          cope with the tens of thousands of tonnes of wreckage strewn across
          the towns and villages of its western Rhinelands after the heaviest
          24-hour deluge on record. The flooding claimed at least 180 lives. A
          week on, much of the trash has been heaped into piles so that streets
          are passable or carted off to makeshift dumps. Then we see heat waves
          that occurred in British Columbia, Canada killed as much as 1 billion
          sea animals. This isn’t a small amount and we humans are to blame for
          the massacre of so many innocent lives. Lebanon is facing Water
          Crisis. Over 71% of people on the risk losing access to water. UNICEF
          says water supply system on the verge of collapse. This could
          skyrocket the prices of water by 200% according to experts. Greenland
          has lost 152 giga tonnes of ice in the year 2020, this has risen ocean
          water levels. It has never snowed in Madrid unless you count the
          ICE-AGE, but it did in 2021 January and not just ordinary snowfall but
          it snowed on a larger scale with heaps of snow accumulated. And if you
          don’t live in these regions then you might say why bother? Right?
          Well, you must because climate change affects you us on a personal
          level too.

        <h3>How climate change affects us on a personal level?</h3>
        <p id="body2-article1">
          Again, due to lack of awareness in people they believe that climate
          change only affects polar bears in the poles or animals in the forest
          or the marine creatures underwater. But no, it affects us on a
          personal level more than you think. There are so many things that is
          getting affected by climate change, to name a few. The size of the
          vegetables and fruits grow into or the flavour and colour of coffee or
          how long it takes for us to travel to the office depends on climate
          change. Due to rising temperatures coffee plants are dying and due to
          heat waves fishes, clamps, sea weed have died. Maharashtra, India in
          2019 shared they had a decline in fish catches by 50%. Why do you ask?
          It’s because of the decline in Phytoplankton aka marine algae which
          the fishes feed on and hence the decrease in fishes. People after the
          Covid-19 Pandemic are never more than ever precautious about their
          health. People have started going to the gyms more, buying all sorts
          of fancy gadgets to measure their health and consuming food that is
          labelled as “healthy”. But do these people realise that rising
          temperatures and climate change is affecting them. Dehydration,
          Hyperthermia, heatstroke and in extreme cases even death. Things you
          can do to help with the issue –<br />
          <b>1. Do not buy cars:</b> Avoid purchasing vehicles (exception are
          electric vehicles). Since electrical vehicles are expensive you might
          as well not buy it and make use of public transport or use online
          facilities like uber or even better just use a bicycle. Major benefits
          of using a bicycle – no gas fee, no parking fee, low maintenance cost
          and YOU STAY FIT!! <br /><b>2. Take lesser flights:</b> Do not take
          flights unless extremely important. Choose Skype or Facetime instead
          or travel by trains but try to decrease your flight trips as much as
          possible. <br /><b>3. Upgrade your tech less:</b> Do not upgrade your
          gadgets like laptops and mobile devices very often just because some
          minor improvements have been made because the resources used to
          manufacture chips is a huge blow to the environment. See if you can
          pull out a few more years on your older machine. Replace the batteries
          if necessary or shop second hand products which are cheap and still
          fairly new. <br /><b>4. Choose the right leaders:</b> Vote politicians
          based on their duties and actions they take towards the environment
          and climate change. This is actually the most important point to look
          at so definitely educate yourself and be more AWARE!! <br /><b
            >5. Plant Trees:</b
          >
          There is no surprise that trees absorb carbon dioxide Co2 from the
          atmosphere. We lose trees through forest fires and deforestation.
          Studies show that a small forest of 50-year-old oak trees can absorb
          as much as 15,000 kgs (30000 pounds) of Co2 per acre. But just
          planting trees alone won’t stop the problem, we must ensure to reduce
          the usage of things that emit greenhouse gases – Nitrous oxides,
          methane, Chloro-fluorocarbons, and Co2. <br /><b>6. Investments:</b>
          Invest in Renewable resource companies and businesses. Divest from
          those companies that have anything to do with coal and petroleum and
          other non-renewable sources. <br /><b>7. Awareness:</b> Be more aware
          about your surrounding and try to keep up with the current affairs of
          the world in the environment field. Try to make time and participate
          in the campaigns and protests that happen towards climate change. They
          try to educate people who do not understand climate change whilst
          keeping it fun, engaging and socializing hence you might meet new
          people with similar interests.

        <!-- conclusion -->
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p id="con-article1">
          The problem here is awareness and priority. Climate change is still
          not a priority to more than half of the population in the world. The
          youth is busy with all sorts of distractions, be it Facebook,
          Instagram or video games. And the adults are busy quarrelling and
          debating on religion, politics, caste and race. While those are
          important topics to ponder upon, we still have a greater threat where
          all of us have to unite irrespective of their religion caste and race.
          But what about the government? They must stop corruption and lower the
          rate of crime involved with nature. For example – not giving sanctions
          to companies and businesses that harm nature or not assigning projects
          that destroy forests and rivers. I know it is a very difficult thing
          to do when businesses are using loop holes and manipulation techniques
          to bypass the laws. And that is why climate change must be looked at
          an individual level. Think about sustainable development and future
          while Asking questions to yourself – Do I want a future with my kids
          and grandkids or Am I living for myself ignoring to notice the CLIMATE
          CHANGE!!
