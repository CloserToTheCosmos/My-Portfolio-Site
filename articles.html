        <p class="intro-article">
          Climate Change is very real and is already in action. It is our planet
          calling out for help. The message is clear, if we do not take any
          action right now to make sure that we have a slightest chance of
          survival then the time is now. Floods, Landslides and Wildfires are on
          the rise out of nowhere. Canada is suffering from a heat wave and
          Germany, China, India and few more countries are suffering from flash
          floods caused by cloud burst rains. These heavy rains are causing
          landslides which are disrupting the nearby civilization and many have
          already lost their lives while a few hundred are missing. This should
          definitely be a wakeup call for us and necessary actions must be taken
          in order to bring back the balance to life, because this is nature’s
          way of showing when the limits are crossed.

        <p class="body-article">
          Recently, there’s an alarming rate of wild fires catching up in
          numerous places, and there are places which you would never imagine
          could catch a wild fire like the colder countries Norway and Siberia.
          Starting from Australia in 2020 to currently in Canada, Arizona,
          California, Oregon, Portland in the north and Amazon in the south of
          America, all in the same year 2021. Contrasting to this, countries in
          Europe mainly Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, and some Asian
          countries India, Turkey, China, Philippines, Oman, and the list goes
          on have been flash flooded by cloud bursts and heavy rains. This is
          something that has never happened before where one part of the world
          was burning and droughted and other part with severe flash floods. Let
          us see where the problem is. China, India and the United States hold
          the top three spots for Co2 emission. Efforts must be made by these
          three countries in order for the rest of the world to follow. UN says
          emission must be cut by 40% by the following decade or temperatures
          could rise drastically which can be fatal. Currently the world is
          under a havoc and is in a state we have never seen before. There are
          flash floods in some regions and wildfires in other regions. Report
          from NOAA states that Wildfire activity amid extreme heat and drought
          has resulted in smoke blanketing much of the United States and Canada.
          As of July 14, 2021, 68 active large fires in 12 states have burned
          more than one million acres of land in the U.S. To date in 2021, more
          than 34,000 fires have burned more than two million acres. This is the
          most fires in the January to July time period since 2011. July is
          relatively early to see wildfire activity of this magnitude. NOAA
          satellites are monitoring the fires, their smoke output, and air
          quality effects from the smoke. The fires are injecting smoke 40,000
          feet into the atmosphere and compromising air quality. New York was
          under a smoke blanket causing irritation and difficulty to breathe for
          the residents of NYC. The Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon is currently
          the nation’s largest active fire. This large, rapidly growing fire
          began on July 6 and had burned 212,377 acres as of July 14. The Oregon
          Department of Environmental Quality issued an air quality advisory for
          south-central and north-eastern Oregon through July 16. InciWeb warned
          that the fire will continue to be extremely active, fuelled by extreme
          drought conditions, low humidity, and high temperatures. And speaking
          of the floods in Germany, the problems are more than just damage and
          destruction. It is now facing Waste Management crisis. July 23
          Germany's most devastating floods in 60 years have created mountains
          of trash, from broken fridges to wrecked cars, piled up on roadsides
          and in makeshift dumps. Disposing of it could take weeks and local
          leaders have appealed for help. Amid the stench and fear of disease,
          the country that pioneered modern waste management is struggling to
          cope with the tens of thousands of tonnes of wreckage strewn across
          the towns and villages of its western Rhinelands after the heaviest
          24-hour deluge on record. The flooding claimed at least 180 lives. A
          week on, much of the trash has been heaped into piles so that streets
          are passable or carted off to makeshift dumps. Then we see heat waves
          that occurred in British Columbia, Canada killed as much as 1 billion
          sea animals. This isn’t a small amount and we humans are to blame for
          the massacre of so many innocent lives. Lebanon is facing Water
          Crisis. Over 71% of people on the risk losing access to water. UNICEF
          says water supply system on the verge of collapse. This could
          skyrocket the prices of water by 200% according to experts. Greenland
          has lost 152 giga tonnes of ice in the year 2020, this has risen ocean
          water levels. It has never snowed in Madrid unless you count the
          ICE-AGE, but it did in 2021 January and not just ordinary snowfall but
          it snowed on a larger scale with heaps of snow accumulated. And if you
          don’t live in these regions then you might say why bother? Right?
          Well, you must because climate change affects you us on a personal
          level too.
        </p>
        <!-- body para 2 -->
        <h3>How climate change affects us on a personal level?</h3>
        <p class="body2-article">
          Again, due to lack of awareness in people they believe that climate
          change only affects polar bears in the poles or animals in the forest
          or the marine creatures underwater. But no, it affects us on a
          personal level more than you think. There are so many things that is
          getting affected by climate change, to name a few. The size of the
          vegetables and fruits grow into or the flavour and colour of coffee or
          how long it takes for us to travel to the office depends on climate
          change. Due to rising temperatures coffee plants are dying and due to
          heat waves fishes, clamps, sea weed have died. Maharashtra, India in
          2019 shared they had a decline in fish catches by 50%. Why do you ask?
          It’s because of the decline in Phytoplankton aka marine algae which
          the fishes feed on and hence the decrease in fishes. People after the
          Covid-19 Pandemic are never more than ever precautious about their
          health. People have started going to the gyms more, buying all sorts
          of fancy gadgets to measure their health and consuming food that is
          labelled as “healthy”. But do these people realise that rising
          temperatures and climate change is affecting them. Dehydration,
          Hyperthermia, heatstroke and in extreme cases even death. Things you
          can do to help with the issue –<br />
          <b>1. Do not buy cars:</b> Avoid purchasing vehicles (exception are
          electric vehicles). Since electrical vehicles are expensive you might
          as well not buy it and make use of public transport or use online
          facilities like uber or even better just use a bicycle. Major benefits
          of using a bicycle – no gas fee, no parking fee, low maintenance cost
          and YOU STAY FIT!! <br /><b>2. Take lesser flights:</b> Do not take
          flights unless extremely important. Choose Skype or Facetime instead
          or travel by trains but try to decrease your flight trips as much as
          possible. <br /><b>3. Upgrade your tech less:</b> Do not upgrade your
          gadgets like laptops and mobile devices very often just because some
          minor improvements have been made because the resources used to
          manufacture chips is a huge blow to the environment. See if you can
          pull out a few more years on your older machine. Replace the batteries
          if necessary or shop second hand products which are cheap and still
          fairly new. <br /><b>4. Choose the right leaders:</b> Vote politicians
          based on their duties and actions they take towards the environment
          and climate change. This is actually the most important point to look
          at so definitely educate yourself and be more AWARE!! <br /><b
            >5. Plant Trees:</b
          >
          There is no surprise that trees absorb carbon dioxide Co2 from the
          atmosphere. We lose trees through forest fires and deforestation.
          Studies show that a small forest of 50-year-old oak trees can absorb
          as much as 15,000 kgs (30000 pounds) of Co2 per acre. But just
          planting trees alone won’t stop the problem, we must ensure to reduce
          the usage of things that emit greenhouse gases – Nitrous oxides,
          methane, Chloro-fluorocarbons, and Co2. <br /><b>6. Investments:</b>
          Invest in Renewable resource companies and businesses. Divest from
          those companies that have anything to do with coal and petroleum and
          other non-renewable sources. <br /><b>7. Awareness:</b> Be more aware
          about your surrounding and try to keep up with the current affairs of
          the world in the environment field. Try to make time and participate
          in the campaigns and protests that happen towards climate change. They
          try to educate people who do not understand climate change whilst
          keeping it fun, engaging and socializing hence you might meet new
          people with similar interests.
        </p>

        <!-- conclusion -->
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p class="con-article">
          The problem here is awareness and priority. Climate change is still
          not a priority to more than half of the population in the world. The
          youth is busy with all sorts of distractions, be it Facebook,
          Instagram or video games. And the adults are busy quarrelling and
          debating on religion, politics, caste and race. While those are
          important topics to ponder upon, we still have a greater threat where
          all of us have to unite irrespective of their religion caste and race.
          But what about the government? They must stop corruption and lower the
          rate of crime involved with nature. For example – not giving sanctions
          to companies and businesses that harm nature or not assigning projects
          that destroy forests and rivers. I know it is a very difficult thing
          to do when businesses are using loop holes and manipulation techniques
          to bypass the laws. And that is why climate change must be looked at
          an individual level. Think about sustainable development and future
          while Asking questions to yourself – Do I want a future with my kids
          and grandkids or Am I living for myself ignoring to notice the CLIMATE
          CHANGE!!

        <h2>Social Media Influence on Body Positivity</h2>
        <!-- Introduction  -->
        <p class="intro-article">
          How many of you look in the mirror and question yourself, Am I
          Healthy? Am I getting fat? But what you really mean is will the
          society accept me. That is the truth and deep down you know it. Did
          you know that Instagram has 140million posts with the tags #health and
          176million posts with the tags #healthy. Pintrest now has a separate
          category for protein showcasing the obsession of health in people. I
          am all for being healthy, but what I am against is the flawed idea of
          health that social media teaches us. They say slim is healthy and
          being healthy is slim with low body fat percentages. We all can agree
          one the fact that this era is all about body insecurities and we
          humans have never been more insecure.
        </p>

        <!-- body para -1 -->

        <p class="body-article">
          The global health industry has grown to such an extent that its worth
          10 trillion dollars in 2021 and is only expected to keep growing. How
          could it possibly get to a stage where it represents 5.8 percent of
          the global economic output. Well, it did and there is no secret to it.
          Products ranging from fat burners, energy drinks and protein
          supplements to medicines that help you sleep well are targeted towards
          us. Using the art of deception and manipulation the so called “health
          companies” have only sold you more products than having the slightest
          concern for your health. They achieve this by tricking our minds to
          set a body goal that is unattainable through a natural lifestyle and
          that you will require their products to even imagine of having a
          sizzling body. Green tea is the highest selling wellness product and
          is often marketed as natural fat burners. This tea is considered to be
          the Elixir to health. As of 2020 the global green tea market value has
          reached 19.9 million dollars and is expected to grow even more in the
          coming years. The truth is green tea cannot help you lose weight. What
          it can do is improve your metabolism rate which fun fact any other tea
          can, be it black, blue, white, English, Oolong, Matcha, you name it.
          Speaking of antioxidants science says there are equal amounts present
          in both black and green tea. This does sound very racist to the tea
          does it not? Hence the question you would ask is should you drink
          green tea? The answer is simple, Sure, but do not count on it for
          losing weight as a simple regular black tea is just as effective
          whilst being cheaper. Here is what else you should not count on,
          Gluten free products. These products are a huge sham. Science says
          gluten is a mixture of proteins like Gliadin and glutelin and it is
          found in mostly all carbohydrates such as wheat, rice and barley.
          Gluten is not harmful for your health unless you suffer from Celiac
          Disease or have an intolerance to gluten. If we look at UK’s
          population, less than 5 percent have this problem yet 12 percent have
          gone gluten free.
        </p>

        <!-- body para 2 -->

        <p class="body2-article">
          Celiac Disease affects roughly 1 percent of the American population
          yet 20 percent have gone gluten free. Is it helping them in weight
          loss? Are they getting any healthier? NO! If you want to lose weight,
          the answer is simple. Losing weight is a game of burning calories, you
          burn more than your maintenance amount you lose weight. You need to
          reach a calorie deficit which you can do by eating junk food or
          healthy food, for instance if your maintenance calorie is 2000 per day
          and you eat 1800 calories every day for a whole month, you end up
          losing weight. Similarly, you eat more calories than your maintenance,
          you bulk up or gain weight. There is no other secret mantra or magical
          drinks that is going to help you lose weight. Coming back to gluten
          free, it is taking away the much-needed carbs that helps in fueling
          your body throughout the day. Moreover, an average gluten free product
          is 242 percent more expensive than their variant that contains gluten.
          In 3 years, the global gluten free market is expected to touch
          6.47Billion dollars and by 2027 it is projected to cross 43.65Billion
          dollars. This is not all, the milk cartons that you see labelled as
          Soya milk and Almond milk are booming right now. We are told that cow
          milk makes us fat. Instagram influencers and fitness bloggers are
          misdirecting you to buy these products. Do you not realize that it is
          they who tell us, the number of calories you consume matters and not
          where it comes from to lose weight. How could you not notice this? Do
          not worry, it is not your fault because these charming influencers
          wrap you in their charm and sell you anything they get sponsored for.
          What you can do is research before taking advice from them. Almond
          milk industry is only growing and is estimated to worth 13.3 billion
          dollars by 2025 and Soya milk industry is estimated at 23.2 billion
          dollars. Apparently, they are any healthier than cow milk. Science
          says that composition wise there is no proof that almond and soya milk
          is healthier than cow milk. When it comes to nutrition density and
          protein content cow milk wins the race. Clearly this is the healthier
          option. The only time you would want to purchase Soy or Almond milk
          cartons is if you are lactose intolerant or a Vegan. Another product
          that is booming is the protein powder and this is a very controversial
          one. Some people believe this is a must if you want to have an
          appealing physique. YouTubers say “go for it, it is worth the
          investment” and almost every YouTuber is promoting a different brand
          or their own personal brand. But what you need to understand is that
          protein powder is a supplement. It is taken if you fail to reach the
          daily protein intake. For a woman its 46gms and for a man its 56gms of
          protein per day. You can reach this goal by eating eggs, chicken, soya
          chunks, milk, nuts, pulses and cereals. And even if you do not hit the
          required amount every day of the week, you will not be terminated or
          die. You need to understand one thing that professionals take the
          supplements to look like that and not everybody needs to look ripped.
          There is no need to spend a fortune on protein powder that is unless
          you want to contribute to its 5.28 billion dollars market. These
          brands will never show any risks involved in taking these supplements
          because even scientists have not found any evidence on its risks, they
          are too new. Do you know what else is popular? The brown alternatives
          of products such as brown rice, brown sugar, brown bread and so on.
          The difference between brown rice and white rice is negligible but
          cost wise the difference is hefty. There is more to so called “healthy
          products”, they are called Heathy Snacks. Air Fried, Cholesterol free,
          low Cal, Fat free, baked…the list goes on. None of these claims
          matter, ingredients do. Many low-fat snacks have added sugar to taste
          good. But companies tend to hide it under technical names, for
          instance MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) will be masked under E621,
          Carrageenan will be called E407. Sugar is the biggest factor in
          deciding your health. The so-called protein bars have all kinds of
          unhealthy sugars to make it taste good. Oh, and vegetable chips are as
          bad as the regular potato chips, so you might as well eat lays and not
          worry about your health. A product is allowed to label itself
          Trans-Fat Free if it adheres to the 0.5gm cap. Either the brands lack
          knowledge in math and English or they do not care about your health,
          what is most likely the case here? I will let you ponder upon it. This
          is just another case of false advertisement. Recently, there has been
          a rise in demand for vitamin water or “healthy water”. A bottle that
          not only comes with water but with added minerals. But technically it
          is just another form of sugar to keep you attached to the drink which
          is labelled to be water. Each of these bottles is said to contain 8
          teaspoons of sugar. This all started when sugar industry hired
          scientists to conduct research and downplay sugar and devilize fat as
          the culprit. This was in the 1960s and since then the information is
          in our subconscious, hence why we believe fat is worse than sugar, but
          in reality, it’s a specific kind of fat that is bad and sugar is just
          bad in general. Coco Cola paid 30million to scientists to prove
          exercise was a more effective way to cut down weight than cutting down
          on food and drinks.

          Finally, know this that nobody in this world cares about your health
          other than you. The health is in your hands and your hands alone.
          Before you listen to your idol bloggers and fitness gods, remember
          they make anything from $200 to 800$ per post. Do not be this
          Orthorexia person (a person who is obsessed with eating healthy) and
          not have the right and logical knowledge. Choose wisely on how you
          decide to stay fit and remember that #Feelinghealthy is a feeling and
          not appearance. Eat what you love but with the knowledge of what you
          are consuming. Because your food is what decides how healthy you are
          and exercise just elevates your process and lifestyle. If you aim to
          stay healthy and fit, here is what you need to know. Home food is
          healthy food. Home food is the only tried and tested superfood. You
          know what is going inside your meals. And if you want to lose weight,
          go on a calorie deficit. So now stop worrying and let your mommy cook
          your food. I will leave by saying, “Healthy does NOT mean starving
          yourself EVER. Healthy means eating the right food in the right
          amount”

        <h2>Food Waste</h2>
        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="intro-article">
          The world produces enough food to feed every single human being. But in the same world 815 million people are suffering from hunger. Why is this the case? Food waste is a big reason. Statistics show that we waste nearly 1.6 billion tons of food every year which is worth $1.6 trillion. An American family spends $2000 on food that they do not consume, that is 40 percent of food that gets produces goes to waste in the US. There is waste at the farm, at the transit, at the supermarket, at restaurants and at homes. Experts believe if we reverse this trend, we could feed 2 billion people that are in need of food.

          Food waste contributes to 8 percent of global emission. Did you know that reducing food waste can have a positive impact on climate change? Because when food is wasted so are the natural resources used to grow the food such as water, land and fertilizer. Apart from these natural resources there are more things that account for climate change due to food waste such as transport of food, storage of food, and food waste accumulation in general. Natural resources such as fresh water is required to grow crops and plants, for animal husbandry, poultry etc. and they account for 66 percent of fresh water usage. The next natural resource used to produce food is land. We cut millions of trees to create land for agricultural use which again requires burning of fossil fuels for the machines to operate and the cutting-down of trees release C02 into the atmosphere. Fertilizers are used to keep the pest away and we all know that they cause water, soil and air pollution. The next stage is transportation where fossil fuels are burnt to transport the food across the globe by land, air and water. Then comes the storage of food which requires heating or cooling of temperatures that again uses fossil fuels and energy. Then there is the last stage to food waste that is the food itself. After the food is rotten and decomposed, it releases methane into the atmosphere which is a part of the green house gases. Not only this but more fossil fuels are burnt to transport waste food from houses to pits. You might have realized by now that food waste is more than what you imagined. Next time you think of throwing a left-over muffin or donut or a fruit think about how it will affect the environment. Now that you know the problem, let’s talk about solutions.

        <p class="body2-article">
          The main reason for food waste is buying excessive amount of food or buying more than required. You are not to blame completely for it, it is the work of the capitalist minded companies that want you to buy their goods irrespective of your needs. What can you do about it? Ignore the ads and posters that call you to buy their goods. Buy only what is needed for you and your family. This also helps keep the price of the goods to a minimum, because more the demand higher the price. Incase you do end up having excess food, you can offer it to the homeless or stray animals. If you cannot find the homeless or stray, then google “donate extra food near me” and you will get lot of organizations that take away extra food. They then donate to those in need. Some more effective methods to reduce food waste are using smaller refrigerators and eating in smaller plates. Because humans have a tendency to fill up the extra space available even though they might not need to. This can help you store only the right amount of food you need and would also notice the food that is available in your refrigerator and while eating your meals you most likely finish the food on your plate. Now all these steps were for the individual level. What about the grocery stores? They can relax cosmetic standards, mark down products, repurpose food within store, donate to nonprofit organizations, feed animals or compost and use it as bio energy for their stores.

        <!-- conclusion -->
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p class="con-article">
          The takeaway is that food waste must be thought about every single day and every single time you have a meal. Respect the food you eat and once you start respecting it you will not throw it away. If somebody asks for food, give them what you think is excess irrespective of its cost because you will most likely throw it away, so it is better to give it to somebody else. “There is food for everyone on this planet, but not everyone eats. “
