              <h2>Climate change is real</h2>
              <p>
                Climate Change is very real and is already in action. It is our
                planet calling out for help. The message is clear, if we do not
                take any action right now to make sure that we have a slightest
                chance of survival then the time is now. Floods, Landslides and
                Wildfires are on the rise out of nowhere. Canada is suffering
                from a heat wave and Germany, China, India and few more
                countries are suffering from flash floods caused by cloud burst
                rains. These heavy rains are causing landslides which are
                disrupting the nearby civilization and many have already lost
                their lives while a few hundred are missing. This should
                definitely be a wakeup call for us and necessary actions must be
                taken in order to bring back the balance to life, because this
                is nature’s way of showing when the limits are crossed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, there’s an alarming rate of wild fires catching up in
                numerous places, and there are places which you would never
                imagine could catch a wild fire like the colder countries Norway
                and Siberia. Starting from Australia in 2020 to currently in
                Canada, Arizona, California, Oregon, Portland in the north and
                Amazon in the south of America, all in the same year 2021.
                Contrasting to this, countries in Europe mainly Germany,
                Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, and some Asian countries India,
                Turkey, China, Philippines, Oman, and the list goes on have been
                flash flooded by cloud bursts and heavy rains. This is something
                that has never happened before where one part of the world was
                burning and droughted and other part with severe flash floods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let us see where the problem is. China, India and the United
                States hold the top three spots for Co2 emission. Efforts must
                be made by these three countries in order for the rest of the
                world to follow. UN says emission must be cut by 40% by the
                following decade or temperatures could rise drastically which
                can be fatal. Currently the world is under a havoc and is in a
                state we have never seen before. There are flash floods in some
                regions and wildfires in other regions. Report from NOAA states
                that Wildfire activity amid extreme heat and drought has
                resulted in smoke blanketing much of the United States and
                Canada. As of July 14, 2021, 68 active large fires in 12 states
                have burned more than one million acres of land in the U.S. To
                date in 2021, more than 34,000 fires have burned more than two
                million acres. This is the most fires in the January to July
                time period since 2011. July is relatively early to see wildfire
                activity of this magnitude. NOAA satellites are monitoring the
                fires, their smoke output, and air quality effects from the
                smoke. The fires are injecting smoke 40,000 feet into the
                atmosphere and compromising air quality. New York was under a
                smoke blanket causing irritation and difficulty to breathe for
                the residents of NYC. The Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon is
                currently the nation’s largest active fire. This large, rapidly
                growing fire began on July 6 and had burned 212,377 acres as of
                July 14. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued
                an air quality advisory for south-central and north-eastern
                Oregon through July 16. InciWeb warned that the fire will
                continue to be extremely active, fuelled by extreme drought
                conditions, low humidity, and high temperatures. And speaking of
                the floods in Germany, the problems are more than just damage
                and destruction. It is now facing Waste Management crisis. July
                23 Germany's most devastating floods in 60 years have created
                mountains of trash, from broken fridges to wrecked cars, piled
                up on roadsides and in makeshift dumps. Disposing of it could
                take weeks and local leaders have appealed for help. Amid the
                stench and fear of disease, the country that pioneered modern
                waste management is struggling to cope with the tens of
                thousands of tonnes of wreckage strewn across the towns and
                villages of its western Rhinelands after the heaviest 24-hour
                deluge on record. The flooding claimed at least 180 lives. A
                week on, much of the trash has been heaped into piles so that
                streets are passable or carted off to makeshift dumps. Then we
                see heat waves that occurred in British Columbia, Canada killed
                as much as 1 billion sea animals. This isn’t a small amount and
                we humans are to blame for the massacre of so many innocent
                lives. Lebanon is facing Water Crisis. Over 71% of people on the
                risk losing access to water. UNICEF says water supply system on
                the verge of collapse. This could skyrocket the prices of water
                by 200% according to experts. Greenland has lost 152 giga tonnes
                of ice in the year 2020, this has risen ocean water levels. It
                has never snowed in Madrid unless you count the ICE-AGE, but it
                did in 2021 January and not just ordinary snowfall but it snowed
                on a larger scale with heaps of snow accumulated. And if you
                don’t live in these regions then you might say why bother?
                Right? Well, you must because climate change affects you us on a
                personal level too.
              </p>
              <h3>How climate change affects us on a personal level?</h3>
              <p>
                Again, due to lack of awareness in people they believe that
                climate change only affects polar bears in the poles or animals
                in the forest or the marine creatures underwater. But no, it
                affects us on a personal level more than you think. There are so
                many things that is getting affected by climate change, to name
                a few. The size of the vegetables and fruits grow into or the
                flavour and colour of coffee or how long it takes for us to
                travel to the office depends on climate change. Due to rising
                temperatures coffee plants are dying and due to heat waves
                fishes, clamps, sea weed have died. Maharashtra, India in 2019
                shared they had a decline in fish catches by 50%. Why do you
                ask? It’s because of the decline in Phytoplankton aka marine
                algae which the fishes feed on and hence the decrease in fishes.
                People after the Covid Pandemic are never more than ever
                precautious about their health. People have started going to the
                gyms more, buying all sorts of fancy gadgets to measure their
                health and consuming food that is labelled as “healthy”. But do
                these people realise that rising temperatures and climate change
                is affecting them. Dehydration, Hyperthermia, heatstroke and in
                extreme cases even death. Things you can do to help with the
                issue – <b>1. Do not buy cars:</b> Avoid purchasing vehicles
                (exception are electric vehicles). Since electrical vehicles are
                expensive you might as well not buy it and make use of public
                transport or use online facilities like uber or even better just
                use a bicycle. Major benefits of using a bicycle – no gas fee,
                no parking fee, low maintenance cost and YOU STAY FIT!!
                <b>2. Take lesser flights:</b> Do not take flights unless
                extremely important. Choose Skype or Facetime instead or travel
                by trains but try to decrease your flight trips as much as
                possible. <b>3. Upgrade your tech less:</b> Do not upgrade your
                gadgets like laptops and mobile devices very often just because
                some minor improvements have been made because the resources
                used to manufacture chips is a huge blow to the environment. See
                if you can pull out a few more years on your older machine.
                Replace the batteries if necessary or shop second hand products
                which are cheap and still fairly new.
                <b>4. Choose the right leaders:</b> Vote politicians based on
                their duties and actions they take towards the environment and
                climate change. This is actually the most important point to
                look at so definitely educate yourself and be more AWARE!!
                <b>5. Plant Trees:</b> There is no surprise that trees absorb
                carbon dioxide Co2 from the atmosphere. We lose trees through
                forest fires and deforestation. Studies show that a small forest
                of 50-year-old oak trees can absorb as much as 15,000 kgs (30000
                pounds) of Co2 per acre. But just planting trees alone won’t
                stop the problem, we must ensure to reduce the usage of things
                that emit greenhouse gases – Nitrous oxides, methane,
                Chloro-fluorocarbons, and Co2. <b>6. Investments:</b> Invest in
                Renewable resource companies and businesses. Divest from those
                companies that have anything to do with coal and petroleum and
                other non-renewable sources. <b>7. Awareness:</b> Be more aware
                about your surrounding and try to keep up with the current
                affairs of the world in the environment field. Try to make time
                and participate in the campaigns and protests that happen
                towards climate change. They try to educate people who do not
                understand climate change whilst keeping it fun, engaging and
                socialising hence you might meet new people with similar
                interests.
              </p>
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                The problem here is awareness and priority. Climate change is
                still not a priority to more than half of the population in the
                world. The youth is busy with all sorts of distractions, be it
                Facebook, Instagram or video games. And the adults are busy
                quarrelling and debating on religion, politics, caste and race.
                While those are important topics to ponder upon, we still have a
                greater threat where all of us have to unite irrespective of
                their religion caste and race. But what about the government?
                They must stop corruption and minimalize the rate of crime
                involved with nature. For example – not giving sanctions to
                companies and businesses that harm nature or not assigning
                projects that destroy forests and rivers. I know it is a very
                difficult thing to do when businesses are using loop holes and
                manipulation techniques to bypass the laws. And that is why
                climate change must be looked at an individual level. Think
                about sustainable development and future while Asking questions
                to yourself – Do I want a future with my kids and grandkids or
                Am I living for myself ignoring to notice the CLIMATE CHANGE!!

              <h2>Social Media Influence on Body Positivity</h2>
              <p>
                How many of you look in the mirror and question yourself, Am I
                Healthy? Am I getting fat? But what you really mean is will the
                society accept me. That is the truth and deep down you know it.
                Did you know that Instagram has 140million posts with the tags
                #health and 176million posts with the tags #healthy. Pinterest
                now has a separate category for protein showcasing the obsession
                of health in people. I am all for being healthy, but what I am
                against is the flawed idea of health that social media teaches
                us. They say slim is healthy and being healthy is slim with low
                body fat percentages. We all can agree one the fact that this
                era is all about body insecurities and we humans have never been
                more insecure.
              </p>
              <p>
                The global health industry has grown to such an extent that its
                worth 10 trillion dollars in 2021 and is only expected to keep
                growing. How could it possibly get to a stage where it
                represents 5.8 percent of the global economic output. Well, it
                did and there is no secret to it. Products ranging from fat
                burners, energy drinks and protein supplements to medicines that
                help you sleep well are targeted towards us. Using the art of
                deception and manipulation the so called “health companies” have
                only sold you more products than having the slightest concern
                for your health. They achieve this by tricking our minds to set
                a body goal that is unattainable through a natural lifestyle and
                that you will require their products to even imagine of having a
                sizzling body. Green tea is the highest selling wellness product
                and is often marketed as natural fat burners. This tea is
                considered to be the Elixir to health. As of 2020 the global
                green tea market value has reached 19.9 million dollars and is
                expected to grow even more in the coming years. The truth is
                green tea cannot help you lose weight. What it can do is improve
                your metabolism rate which fun fact any other tea can, be it
                black, blue, white, English, Oolong, Matcha, you name it.
                Speaking of antioxidants science says there are equal amounts
                present in both black and green tea. This does sound very racist
                to the tea does it not? Hence the question you would ask is
                should you drink green tea? The answer is simple, Sure, but do
                not count on it for losing weight as a simple regular black tea
                is just as effective whilst being cheaper. Here is what else you
                should not count on, Gluten free products. These products are a
                huge sham. Science says gluten is a mixture of proteins like
                Gliadin and glutelin and it is found in mostly all carbohydrates
                such as wheat, rice and barley. Gluten is not harmful for your
                health unless you suffer from Celiac Disease or have an
                intolerance to gluten. If we look at UK’s population, less than
                5 percent have this problem yet 12 percent have gone gluten
                free. Celiac Disease affects roughly 1 percent of the American
                population yet 20 percent have gone gluten free. Is it helping
                them in weight loss? Are they getting any healthier? NO! If you
                want to lose weight, the answer is simple. Losing weight is a
                game of burning calories, you burn more than your maintenance
                amount you lose weight. You need to reach a calorie deficit
                which you can do by eating junk food or healthy food, for
                instance if your maintenance calorie is 2000 per day and you eat
                1800 calories every day for a whole month, you end up losing
                weight. Similarly, you eat more calories than your maintenance,
                you bulk up or gain weight. There is no other secret mantra or
                magical drinks that is going to help you lose weight. Coming
                back to gluten free, it is taking away the much-needed carbs
                that helps in fueling your body throughout the day. Moreover, an
                average gluten free product is 242 percent more expensive than
                their variant that contains gluten. In 3 years, the global
                gluten free market is expected to touch 6.47Billion dollars and
                by 2027 it is projected to cross 43.65Billion dollars. This is
                not all, the milk cartons that you see labelled as Soya milk and
                Almond milk are booming right now. We are told that cow milk
                makes us fat. Instagram influencers and fitness bloggers are
                misdirecting you to buy these products. Do you not realize that
                it is they who tell us, the number of calories you consume
                matters and not where it comes from to lose weight. How could
                you not notice this? Do not worry, it is not your fault because
                these charming influencers wrap you in their charm and sell you
                anything they get sponsored for. What you can do is research
                before taking advice from them. Almond milk industry is only
                growing and is estimated to worth 13.3 billion dollars by 2025
                and Soya milk industry is estimated at 23.2 billion dollars.
                Apparently, they are any healthier than cow milk. Science says
                that composition wise there is no proof that almond and soya
                milk is healthier than cow milk. When it comes to nutrition
                density and protein content cow milk wins the race. Clearly this
                is the healthier option. The only time you would want to
                purchase Soy or Almond milk cartons is if you are lactose
                intolerant or a Vegan. Another product that is booming is the
                protein powder and this is a very controversial one. Some people
                believe this is a must if you want to have an appealing
                physique. Youtubers say “go for it, it is worth the investment”
                and almost every youtuber is promoting a different brand or
                their own personal brand. But what you need to understand is
                that protein powder is a supplement. It is taken if you fail to
                reach the daily protein intake. For a woman its 46gms and for a
                man its 56gms of protein per day. You can reach this goal by
                eating eggs, chicken, soya chunks, milk, nuts, pulses and
                cereals. And even if you do not hit the required amount every
                day of the week, you will not be terminated or die. You need to
                understand one thing that professionals take the supplements to
                look like that and not everybody needs to look ripped. There is
                no need to spend a fortune on protein powder that is unless you
                want to contribute to its 5.28 billion dollars market. These
                brands will never show any risks involved in taking these
                supplements because even scientists have not found any evidence
                on its risks, they are too new. Do you know what else is
                popular? The brown alternatives of products such as brown rice,
                brown sugar, brown bread and so on. The difference between brown
                rice and white rice is negligible but cost wise the difference
                is hefty. There is more to so called “healthy products”, they
                are called Heathy Snacks. Air Fried, Cholesterol free, low Cal,
                Fat free, baked…the list goes on. None of these claims matter,
                ingredients do. Many low-fat snacks have added sugar to taste
                good. But companies tend to hide it under technical names, for
                instance MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) will be masked under E621,
                Carrageenan will be called E407. Sugar is the biggest factor in
                deciding your health. The so-called protein bars have all kinds
                of unhealthy sugars to make it taste good. Oh, and vegetable
                chips are as bad as the regular potato chips, so you might as
                well eat lays and not worry about your health. A product is
                allowed to label itself Trans-Fat Free if it adheres to the
                0.5gm cap. Either the brands lack knowledge in math and English
                or they do not care about your health, what is most likely the
                case here? I will let you ponder upon it. This is just another
                case of false advertisement. Recently, there has been a rise in
                demand for vitamin water or “healthy water”. A bottle that not
                only comes with water but with added minerals. But technically
                it is just another form of sugar to keep you attached to the
                drink which is labelled to be water. Each of these bottles is
                said to contain 8 teaspoons of sugar. This all started when
                sugar industry hired scientists to conduct research and downplay
                sugar and devilize fat as the culprit. This was in the 1960s and
                since then the information is in our subconscious, hence why we
                believe fat is worse than sugar, but in reality, it’s a specific
                kind of fat that is bad and sugar is just bad in general. Coco
                Cola paid 30million to scientists to prove exercise was a more
                effective way to cut down weight than cutting down on food and
                drinks.

              <p>
                Finally, know this that nobody in this world cares about your
                health other than you. The health is in your hands and your
                hands alone. Before you listen to your idol bloggers and fitness
                gods, remember they make anything from $200 to 800$ per post. Do
                not be this Orthorexia person (a person who is obsessed with
                eating healthy) and not have the right and logical knowledge.
                Choose wisely on how you decide to stay fit and remember that
                #Feelinghealthy is a feeling and not appearance. Eat what you
                love but with the knowledge of what you are consuming. Because
                your food is what decides how healthy you are and exercise just
                elevates your process and lifestyle. If you aim to stay healthy
                and fit, here is what you need to know. Home food is healthy
                food. Home food is the only tried and tested superfood. You know
                what is going inside your meals. And if you want to lose weight,
                go on a calorie deficit. So now stop worrying and let your mommy
                cook your food. I will leave by saying, “Healthy does NOT mean
                starving yourself EVER. Healthy means eating the right food in
                the right amount”

              <h2>Food Waste</h2>
              <p>
                The world produces enough food to feed every single human being.
                But in the same world 815 million people are suffering from
                hunger. Why is this the case? Food waste is a big reason.
                Statistics show that we waste nearly 1.6 billion tons of food
                every year which is worth $1.6 trillion. An American family
                spends $2000 on food that they do not consume, that is 40
                percent of food that gets produces goes to waste in the US.
                There is waste at the farm, at the transit, at the supermarket,
                at restaurants and at homes. Experts believe if we reverse this
                trend, we could feed 2 billion people that are in need of food.
              </p>
              <p>
                Food waste contributes to 8 percent of global emission. Did you
                know that reducing food waste can have a positive impact on
                climate change? Because when food is wasted so are the natural
                resources used to grow the food such as water, land and
                fertilizer. Apart from these natural resources there are more
                things that account for climate change due to food waste such as
                transport of food, storage of food, and food waste accumulation
                in general. Natural resources such as fresh water is required to
                grow crops and plants, for animal husbandry, poultry etc. and
                they account for 66 percent of fresh water usage. The next
                natural resource used to produce food is land. We cut millions
                of trees to create land for agricultural use which again
                requires burning of fossil fuels for the machines to operate and
                the cutting-down of trees release C02 into the atmosphere.
                Fertilizers are used to keep the pest away and we all know that
                they cause water, soil and air pollution. The next stage is
                transportation where fossil fuels are burnt to transport the
                food across the globe by land, air and water. Then comes the
                storage of food which requires heating or cooling of
                temperatures that again uses fossil fuels and energy. Then there
                is the last stage to food waste that is the food itself. After
                the food is rotten and decomposed, it releases methane into the
                atmosphere which is a part of the green house gases. Not only
                this but more fossil fuels are burnt to transport waste food
                from houses to pits. You might have realized by now that food
                waste is more than what you imagined. Next time you think of
                throwing a left-over muffin or donut or a fruit think about how
                it will affect the environment. Now that you know the problem,
                let’s talk about solutions. The main reason for food waste is
                buying excessive amount of food or buying more than required.
                You are not to blame completely for it, it is the work of the
                capitalist minded companies that want you to buy their goods
                irrespective of your needs. What can you do about it? Ignore the
                ads and posters that call you to buy their goods. Buy only what
                is needed for you and your family. This also helps keep the
                price of the goods to a minimum, because more the demand higher
                the price. Incase you do end up having excess food, you can
                offer it to the homeless or stray animals. If you cannot find
                the homeless or stray, then google “donate extra food near me”
                and you will get lot of organizations that take away extra food.
                They then donate to those in need. Some more effective methods
                to reduce food waste are using smaller refrigerators and eating
                in smaller plates. Because humans have a tendency to fill up the
                extra space available even though they might not need to. This
                can help you store only the right amount of food you need and
                would also notice the food that is available in your
                refrigerator and while eating your meals you most likely finish
                the food on your plate. Now all these steps were for the
                individual level. What about the grocery stores? They can relax
                cosmetic standards, mark down products, repurpose food within
                store, donate to nonprofit organizations, feed animals or
                compost and use it as bio energy for their stores.
              </p>
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                The takeaway is that food waste must be thought about every
                single day and every single time you have a meal. Respect the
                food you eat and once you start respecting it you will not throw
                it away. If somebody asks for food, give them what you think is
                excess irrespective of its cost because you will most likely
                throw it away, so it is better to give it to somebody else.

                eats. “

              <h2>Capitalism – Boon or a bane?</h2>
              <p>
                Death is upon us. The death of glaciers and ice sheets melting
                into the sea. The death of forests, the death of reefs bleaching
                white in pain, and the death of people killed by storms,
                droughts, fires, austerity and the state. By putting all of this
                together, we can call it climate change. You might be wondering,
                why are we talking about climate change when the title is
                capitalism. Well, it is because of the developed countries
                choosing a liberal economy also called as capitalism, that we
                have reached this stage today. The stage where our generation is
                nearing its end.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, what is capitalism? In simple terms, it is a free economy
                where private businesses can market their goods without any
                intervention from the government. Now this is good because
                companies will keep producing goods that are cheaper than their
                competition and more advanced. As consumers, we enjoy cheap and
                advanced products. All of the developed countries fall inside
                capitalist idea of development. All of this is great to the
                business companies because they are getting all the profits in
                the world and this is great for the consumers as well because
                they can happily use advanced products without having to pay a
                huge amount. If you notice closely, the charts of rise in
                green-house emissions, you can see that the beginning of
                capitalism and the rise of emissions and the rise of capitalism
                go together. But how has capitalism changed our environment? It
                has in the form on waste. What do you consider as a waste?
                Anything that is not of use to us is a waste. And that is what
                the companies are creating. They are creating useless products
                and marketing it as useful products. By playing with your minds
                with the help of advertisements, they make you believe that you
                must have their new jeans, their new smartphone, their new car
                etc. Now you might have a perfectly working smartphone, you
                might have a perfectly working car and you might have enough
                jeans for an entire week, yet the advertisements make you
                reconsider. This is just the start, and then they showcase their
                limited time offers and groundbreaking, earthshattering deals
                that only is there for a limited time. First, they catch your
                attention with a brand-new product and then they create a sense
                of fear that you are losing out or missing out on the latest and
                greatest using time frame. You are left with no option but to
                buy their products irrespective of the need. Hence it is not you
                to be blamed for having extra money, it is the capitalistic
                mindset of the companies that are trying to sell. It is their
                greed for profits, it is their ignorant behavior towards climate
                change and environmental concerns. Let us spread awareness to
                our family, friends, neighbors and fight this collectively.
                Because united, we can make it happen!
              </p>
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                Finally, on an individual level, you can help the environment by
                not falling in the rat race for having the latest and greatest
                to seek attention and social status, and if you are stuck, then
                analyze yourself, seek help if you need, but do not buy goods
                for social status. Know one thing, these companies do not care
                about you. You might see them advertise – “We care”, “Customers
                are our first priority” and all other nicer things you would
                want to hear, but what they actually mean is “WE WANT YOUR
                MONEY”. You need to understand this. The only way to end
                capitalism is to boycott them and only buy what you need. Buying
                what you need actually puts you one step closer to having a
                slightest chance at survival and you are reducing your carbon
                footprint. This can become easier if you choose to live a
                minimal lifestyle. Remember that it is you who has the POWER, do
                not let these companies take it away from you.

                March 2019 was a start to a global pandemic caused by a virus
                that took lives in millions, disrupted lives, increased mental
                health issues, increased unemployment and the poorer section of
                the society were affected the most in general. But this article
                is not about the death or the number of active cases nor about
                the struggling lives of the poor. It is about the environment
                and how covid – 19 has brought a “positive” change in the
                environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let us see what the other side of covid-19 is. Climate change is
                something that is constantly spoken of since the early 1900s
                till date but only when natural disasters occur. Politicians
                make fake promises of taking action towards climate change. And
                now the recent most natural disaster is the covid-19 virus and
                it is all we can think about. While leaving the house, we used
                to check for wallet and keys, but now we check for wallet, keys,
                mask and a sanitizer. That is how much of an impact covid-19 has
                made. And because of the pandemic travel restrictions and
                working from home, the pollution levels in all fields have
                fallen drastically, be it water, land or air. It is like as if
                mother Earth took a deep breath of relief after such a long
                cycle of pain that never stopped. But this is not sustainable
                and China is already showcasing this. They were the first
                country to quickly comeback from the pandemic in rebuilding
                economy. When every other country had a reduction in pollution
                levels of as much as 14%, China was only at 1.5%. But these
                figures are a start to building up concern in people. They are
                finally seeing it that Climate change is real and it is already
                at the end stage. The covid-19 pandemic crisis was just the mere
                glimpse of what is yet to come, a bigger crisis of rising
                temperature and the consequences of it could be immeasurable.
                There is another huge challenge which the countries have to face
                post pandemic, that is how to deal with “getting back to normal
                syndrome”. Experts believe that there will be two kinds of
                people after the pandemic ends. There will be those that have
                already adjusted to the new norms and there will be those that
                will revert back to the pre-pandemic lifestyle. This could be
                problematic and this where the government must take necessary
                rules and guidelines to ensure every single citizen are on the
                same mindset. Let us look at this with an example, ask yourself
                about what is the first thing you would do after the pandemic is
                over. I’m certain that majority of you want to go on a world
                tour or just some tour and have fun, because the pandemic has
                shown us that life is short. This can be problematic if every
                single on of you have a similar mindset. This will increase the
                pollutions at two times the rate because now there are two times
                more people that feel the same way. People need to understand
                that everyone’s life had taken a hit and all of us are still
                suffering in some way or the other. But most importantly the
                environment has been suffering like this since the age of
                capitalism, which is not even close to what we are going
                through. Remember that without a stable and healthy mother
                Earth, its children will never be healthy. We are the children
                and it is our duty to take care of our mother. That is the least
                we can do, and we owe it to her. If you are not able to figure
                out on how to help mother Earth, do not worry. Start by googling
                “How can I help towards Climate Change”. Or follow some of these
                steps given below: 1. Buying second hand/used goods 2. Choosing
                travel destinations that can be reached with less flights or no
                flights 3. Choosing to travel on foot/bicycle 4. Choosing public
                transport over private vehicles 5. Choosing home stays and guest
                houses instead of resorts and 5-star hotels 6. Most importantly,
                Maintaining sanitation and hygiene By following the above steps
                while travelling can help the environment and help you in the
                long run. Let us use these points to see how it works. So, you
                have decided to travel and take amazing pictures and post it on
                social media and just have a great time alone or with family and
                friends. You decide to buy a camera and you go to a camera store
                or go onto Amazon to order yourself a brand-new camera. This is
                where you must stop yourself. Instead, check for used options
                which are maintained well, which are cheaper than brand new. Or
                see if your smartphone is enough, because these days phones have
                gotten so powerful and advanced. This point applies to all sorts
                of goods from cameras to laptops to clothing to accessories. The
                next point to keep in mind is to choose a destination that takes
                lesser flights or no flights at all. Flights alone contribute 7%
                to global emissions. So, explore your own country through trains
                and buses or fly to countries that require minimum flying. This
                not only helps you know more about your own country but also
                helps the environment. The next point is using your foot or a
                bicycle to travel. Lately, lot of new full-time travelers are
                choosing to travel on bikes or by hitch-hiking (which is
                basically to take drops from random strangers to reach a
                destination) This must all be too new for some that are starting
                out. But they believe that “it is the journey that makes it fun
                while travelling and not the destination”. But this type of
                travelling is not for everyone, certainly not for the elderly
                which brings my next point. Travel in public transport. They are
                cheaper, reliable and cover insurance (can vary from area to
                area). This can save you a lot of money and sometimes even time
                if you have already planned your trip. But there will always be
                some group of people who cannot travel by foot, bicycle nor
                public transport and the exceptional group of people such as
                physically challenged and elderly who cannot walk or climb
                stairs could benefit from private vehicles or tour plans
                organized by trip organizers. Next important thing to note is
                that we will require a stay at a certain location. Choosing to
                stay with locals is the best option as it will allow you to
                really get to know the culture of the place and eat the culture
                rich food which let’s be honest won’t be accurate in
                restaurants. And the downside in living inside hotels can become
                very expensive as you start visiting famous places due to the
                demand. Adding to this there are environmental pollutions that
                hotels make that is burning up electricity for fancy lightings,
                food waste, water wastage, Air pollution by all the
                air-conditioning and this happens on a huge scale, because
                hotels have more than 500 rooms. So, you can save the cluster
                and pollution by opting to stay in home stays or guest houses.
                The last thing you need to worry about is hygiene. After the
                current pandemic, I am certain most of you already have a
                hygienic routine, which is good. But try to take care of nature
                to. The basics such as not littering, using recyclable products,
                sanitation inside toilets, all these things that protect the
                environment must be followed.

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                The conclusion is to look at things from a positive perspective,
                but also be aware of the negative side. This mindset can help
                you grow in life and let your surroundings grow simultaneously.
                Coming to climate change, it is a crisis of an event, hence
                treat it like a crisis. Make it a priority and remember that you
                do not have to be an activist to fight against climate change,
                you only have to be a responsible citizen.

              <h3>Sugar – An addiction worse than Cocaine?</h3>
              <p>
                You say “Just one bite” and you end up eating the whole thing.
                It doesn’t just stop there, you most likely will feel like
                eating more. If you have noticed this sort of a behavior while
                having sweets, have you wondered why. Do you know why you feel
                so addicted to sugary sweet things? Do you know why they do not
                make you feel full even though you have eaten a whole pack of
                chocolate bar? But you feel full after eating just 2 big
                bananas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let us look at it mathematically, A pack of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk
                Silk Chocolate Bar consists of 730 calories for the 120gm pack
                that costs about 148 Rupees, whereas a Big Banana consists of
                100 calories and you can eat about 7 of them to match a
                Chocolate bar. And 1kg of Banana (7-8units) cost varies from 22
                rupees to 35 rupees. We did the math and nobody in their right
                mind would think about eating 7 bananas at one go, unless you
                are a professional athlete and you are bulking. Yet we never
                consider about the 1 packet of chocolate bar, even though they
                are the same calories as that of 7 Bananas. What’s funny is both
                of them are sweet yet most people will pick up the chocolate bar
                instead of 7 Bananas. This is why we see millions of kids
                becoming overweight and obese every year. The chart is only
                rising and rising at an alarming rate, and there is no way to
                slow this down unless the parents make their children strong
                mentally. You might be wondering, what does food have to do with
                mental strength? Bitterly, it is all about the mental strength.
                Let us look at how Capitalism and Marketing is affecting you
                mentally. Let us say, a brand hired your favorite celebrity to
                “market” a product as a Brand Ambassador and even though the
                product is not good for your health, the brand will market it as
                “healthy”. The brand knows its unhealthy, your favorite
                celebrity who marketed it knows its unhealthy, but the victim is
                you. Without proper awareness and research, you believe in the
                ad and you consume it and it does not stop there. Two people
                watching you eat and reviewing it will start consuming it
                eventually, your family members and your friends. This is the
                power of marketing and how the brands are making millions. The
                more you spend on unhealthy products, the double and quadruple
                times you will have to later pay on hospital bills.
                #InvestmentGoals right? Let us look at the problem from a
                scientific perspective whilst keeping it simple. Sweetness or
                the sugar is nothing but Glucose. But there are 2 more elements
                that are present in glucose – sucrose and fructose. These are
                the only 3 things you need to consider while consuming anything
                that is sweet. Glucose and sucrose are the good side of sugar,
                that is all the fruits and vegetables. Also notice how they are
                rich in fiber. Even our Fiber consumption has gone down since
                the 1960s. And Fructose is the bad side of sugar and this is
                present in everything that is refined and processed. Why is it
                bad? It is bad because fructose is a hepatotoxin (alcohol
                without the buzz). And unlike glucose and sucrose that get
                converted to energy after consumption and is used by the entire
                body, fructose stores it in your stomach (fructose is not
                processed by the brain, hence making you feel hungry even after
                eating two packs of chips) resulting in a fat gut which is
                wobbly and soft which is also known as obesity. It builds up
                after every time you ingest fructose into your body. There is
                fructose in soft drinks, energy drinks, biscuits, cookies,
                chocolates, chips, jams and sauce and the list go on. Glucose
                and Sucrose are considered good because they have been there
                since the very beginning of the Earth. They are known to be
                digested easily after consumption. Whereas fructose has also
                been in fruits and vegetables, but at a very low percentage
                which had almost no impact on the health. This is why you must
                have heard from your parents or grandparents that the life was
                better before Ice-creams, biscuits and McDonalds. They were
                right, it indeed was. In the pre-sugar era, most parts of the
                world used dates, coconuts and sugarcane juices or solidified
                jaggery as sweeteners. After 1960, the Americans introduced
                sugar to the entire world and later fructose that was a cheaper
                alternative to sugar but sweeter and deadlier. Since then, the
                rise of obesity has only been climbing up. The worst problem to
                consuming sugary/fructose added products is the addiction stage.
                Once you consume it, you will want to come back to it and the
                cycle goes on and you might not even see it as a threat. The FDA
                (The Food and Drug Administration) duty is to keep checks on bad
                food and regulate rules but will not tell you about chronic
                threats, they will only keep a check on instant threats and
                hence cocaine is banned and fructose which is a slow killing
                poison still in use. But there are some countries that do keep a
                check like the Nordic countries have added huge taxations on
                fructose products encouraging people indirectly to buy healthier
                options. Scientists from the brands that sell sugary products
                often publish reports on how fat is bad for your health and
                provoke you in buying “FAT-FREE” or “LOW-FAT” products. These
                scientists never showcase how bad fructose is even though they
                know it, and they also know that without the use of fructose
                their products will not taste good and nobody would come back to
                purchase them. They use fat as the devil and hide fructose under
                it. Whereas we all know there are two sides of fat, the good and
                the bad. Yet people till date think twice before buying milk,
                the regular or the low-fat milk. The cream which is the fat in
                milk is so essential, having plenty of nutrients but people
                still believe drinking low-fat milk will keep them fit and
                skinny. This is what happens to people with low awareness or
                half information about nutrition, because false knowledge and
                half truth is more dangerous than ignorance. Let us come to
                solutions now. What can we do? It is simple, buy products that
                do not have fructose in it. What are those products? Everything
                that is not processed or packed inside a tin. Cook your own
                meals because home food is the true Super Food and nothing even
                comes close to being as healthy as home food. This way you can
                eliminate all the fructose products while cooking, for example –
                jams and sauce and taste makers and white refined sugar, cheap
                quality honey and ready-made noodles, cup noodles and pastas,
                canned foods, milk shakes, bakery foods and the list goes on but
                you get the idea. High intake of these products on a regular
                basis can lead to the damage in kidney and liver developing
                metabolism syndrome, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), type-2
                diabetes, dyslipidemia, inflammation, hepatic insulin
                resistance, obesity. What to consume then? Everything that is
                grown fresh, raw and has fiber in it, for example – green leafy
                veggies, all fruits, jaggery(brown) coconut sugar, dates sugar,
                using any of these as sweeteners will not be fatal. Increasing
                fiber and protein intake will boost your metabolism and this is
                the key to burning fat.

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                The takeaway is that, the next time you worry about losing
                weight or not being able to cut down on fat percentage even
                though you workout everyday, know this that a calorie is not a
                calorie and fructose is not glucose. Because you could be eating
                1000 calories worth of fructose products hence the no result.
                For instance, if your maintenance calorie amount is 2000
                calories a day and you consume exactly 2000 calories, you will
                have the same weight but not the same fat percentage. You will
                look more bloated and put on more fat as you store more and more
                fructose in your body. So, go through your kitchen and analyze
                the fructose added products, eliminate sugar completely and
                alternate it with sweeteners such as jaggery(brown) which is as
                sweet as sugar but has more nutrients and costs almost the same.
                The next best alternative is honey and Coconut sugar and Dates
                sugar but they can be expensive. If you truly want to live a
                healthy, fit lifestyle then practicing fancy diets like keto
                diet, low-carb diet, low-fat diet will not work. They are all
                marketing gimmicks and that is the reason their products are so
                expensive and also the reason why the health industry is
                booming. The simple logical explanation given by science itself
                is to consume all the nutrients (carbs, proteins, fats,
                multi-vitamins, iron, zinc, calcium). You can higher or lower
                the consumption according to your body’s need and deficiency but
                consuming all the nutrients is the key to Healthy Lifestyle.
